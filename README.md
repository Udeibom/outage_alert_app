## üß† Overview

The **Outage Alert App** estimates the probability of a power outage (`OFF = 0`) for a given hour and location.  
It combines features like:

- üìÖ Time & day (hour, weekday, weekend)
- üå¶Ô∏è Environmental inputs (temperature, humidity, rain)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Recent outage history (1-hour and 24-hour lags)
- üèôÔ∏è Location-based one-hot encoding

## ‚ú® Key Features

‚úÖ **Single-hour Prediction** ‚Äì Input your time, weather, and recent outage duration to get an instant forecast.  
‚úÖ **24-hour Outlook** ‚Äì See outage probability trends across the day.  
‚úÖ **Explainability (SHAP)** ‚Äì Understand why the model made a prediction (e.g., rain, lag features).  
‚úÖ **Threshold Control** ‚Äì Adjust sensitivity for outage alerts.  
‚úÖ **Interactive Charts** ‚Äì Visualize outage probability throughout the day.

## üß© Model

The app uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on time + weather + lag-based features.  
Predictions are expressed as probabilities:  
- **OFF = 0 (Outage)**  
- **ON = 1 (Power available)**  

> For best results, users can provide the recent power status 1 hour and 24 hours ago.
